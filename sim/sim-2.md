# Your First Software Type

To begin, create a folder for your mod name it `MyFirstDataMod`. Inside that folder create a folder called `SoftwareTypes`. This is where your software will go.

Create a file called `MyFirstSoftware.tyd`, open it in a text editor \(we recommend [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as it is the only editor with a [TyD language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Matthew-Adcock.tyd-lang)\).
