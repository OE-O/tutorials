## How It Works

In Software Inc. there are 4 types of mods that can be made using simple text files, or using C# for complex changes. Most mods rely on the [TyD](/languages/TyD) file format.

### Data Mods

Data mods can add, change or remove software types, AI company types, name generators and employee personalities. This is all done with TyD files, however, software types can have scripts attached using SIPL.

### Code Mods

If you want to dive even further, you can put .cs files directly with the game, and it will compile and load your scripts on startup. For more control, you can compile your own DLL files for the game to load.

### Furniture

You can add furniture using .obj 3D object files. The furniture modding system, while only using TyD files, allows you to change pretty much anything about your furniture that would be possible to change from within the game's engine.

### Materials

Material mods allow you to load textures into the game for interior walls, exterior walls, floors, roofs and paths.
