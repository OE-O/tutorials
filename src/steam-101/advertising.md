# Advertising

::: danger
Advertise at your own risk, make sure to follow the rules of wherever you are advertising.
:::

This page won't give you any info, just a list of places you could advertise:

* **Reddit** - Most games have a reddit page, if advertising mods isn't stated in the rules, you are probably more than welcome to.
* **Discord** - Most games have a modding channel on their discord, if advertising isn't stated in the server's rules, you will probably be more than welcome to show your mod off. Discord Invites are a no-no when advertising on Discord.
* **Steam** - Create a discussion post on a steam forum. On most steam forums you can post discord invites, link, and screenshots.
