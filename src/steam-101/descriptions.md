# Descriptions

Did you know that only **45%** of steam workshop users read the description? If you think about it. There are **20.31 million** steam users that play daily. Which means only **9,139,500** players actually check the description.

This may seem a lot, but that's all the games on steam combined.

When players do read the description, its usually because they are interested in the mod, something catches their eye or they want more information.

### Eye Catching

"Eye Catching" is the means of making people look at things because they saw something moving, something shiny or something attractive.

### Informational

Most people view the description for information. The first 5 lines of the description must not have any BBCode or formatting as BBCode is visible when the user hovers over the item: 

It's best to place a TL:DR \(Too Long Didn't Read\).

#### What is a TL:DR?

A TL:DR is a short sentence that summarises a large paragraph, usually they go at the bottom of the page, but for description purposes, they go at the top.

#### Do's and Don'ts

| Do | Don't |
| :-----:  | :-----: |
| Add a TL:DR at the top of your page. | Use BBCode formatting at the top of your page. |
| Use picture banners to separate parts of the description. | Create the entire description using images. |
| Use lists to allow users to understand your item. | Use the wrong BBCode Tags for the wrong purpose. |
