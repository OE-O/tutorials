# Preview Images

Preview Images are the first thing you ever see of a Workshop Item. Preview Images come in two formats, square, and screen.

::: warning Square preview images
* must keep a 1:1 Aspect ratio
* should be at least 512px by 512px
:::

::: warning Screen preview images
* should have a 16:9 Aspect ratio
* should be at least 1920x1080 for correct sizing.
:::

For Square preview images, its best to grab a screenshot of your mod up close, or if its not visible in-game, text can suffice.

For Screen preview images, try and get as much in as possible, adding banners, descriptions etc. If its not visible in-game, a small title with a sub-title would be reccomended.

Some popualar image editors that Steam content creators use:

* [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html) \(Windows, Mac\)
* [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) \(Windows, Mac, Linux\)
