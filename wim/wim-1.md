# Introduction

> wim-1

In this guide, we will teach you how to get people to subscribe to your workshop item. This can apply not only to mods but generally any workshop item.

Many people subscribe to a workshop item because:

* It looks good
* It removes/fixes an annoying part of the game
* It has lots of content
* It stands out
* It adds something the developers cancelled but players still wanted

In Workshop Item Recognition 101, you will learn:

* How to make descriptions players will actually be bothered to read
* How to create high-quality preview pictures
* How to advertise your item
